## Bug *alpha*
>>In the initial test-file.md case, we only demonstrated that our code can read in a file as a parameter -and- the code's basic recognition of: 
[inline-style links](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)
>>one of many formats for including Markdown links.
>However, what would happen if we were to add a body of text before and after the last recognizable link like we just did now ...
>Afterwards, we will include ***print*** statements at the start and end of the ***while loop*** to trace the behavior of the symptom and track down the bug.
