## Bug *&beta;*
In the initial test-file.md case, we only demonstrated that our code can read in a file as a parameter -and- the code's basic recognition of: 
>[inline-style links](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)
>[one more link](https://some-other-link.com)

Similarly to `links` in markdown - images are almost identical in format - for example:
>![link](https://github.com/jhugomagana/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/assets/images/i_am_Link.jpg?raw=true)
If you were to see the markdown format of this image, it nearly identical to link format but with an "!" preceding the `[]` brackets.
